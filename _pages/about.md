I have been an Assitant Research Professor at Old Dominion University since January 2024. My research focuses on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning using Homomorphic Encryption. For an overview on the topic <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9936637'>have a look at this paper</a>. I focus on the usability and 
efficiency on HE-based machine learning.

I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia State University in 2024.

From 2012-2017 I was a system developer with Sirrix, now <a href='https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/solutions/cybersecurity'>Rohde & Schwarz Cybersecuiryt</a>.
